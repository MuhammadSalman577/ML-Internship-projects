# ML-Internship-projects
The project consists of two basic ML projects built as task during my Internship with Arch technologies.
The repository contains two projects one is spam email detection model built using python with random forest classifier and other is Mnist digit recognition model built using tensorflow and openCV.

# Spam email detection:
Spam email detection model is first trained on labeled dataset. During the preprocessing the dataset with Text label which contains the actual email is refined and normalized first through stemming and than vectorized for the models traning and than dataset is feeded in to the model for training.

# Mnist digit recognition:
For creating a mnist digit recognition model first the neural networks is created through layering using tensorflow and than the neural networks created are saved.The hand written digits are preporcessed using openCV and than feeded into the neural networks, the neural nets than make the prediction based on the the pattern.
