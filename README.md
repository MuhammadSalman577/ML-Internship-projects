# ML-Internship-projects
The project consists of two basic ML projects built as task during my Internship with Arch technologies.
The repository contains two projects one is spam email detection model built using python with random forest classifier and other is Mnist digit recognition model built using tensorflow and openCV.

# Spam email detection:
Spam email detection model is first trained on labeled dataset. During the preprocessing the dataset with Text label which contains the actual email is refined and normalized first through stemming and than vectorized for the model to make training simple and than dataset is fed in to the model for training.
