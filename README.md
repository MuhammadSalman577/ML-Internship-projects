# Mnist digit recognition:
For creating a mnist digit recognition model, first the neural networks is created through layering using tensorflow and than the neural networks 
created are saved.The hand written digits are preprocessed using openCV and than fed into the neural networks, the neural nets than make the prediction based on the pattern.
